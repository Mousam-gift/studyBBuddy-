            "*   **Hydration:** Keep a reusable water bottle filled and sip throughout the day. Dehydration can impair concentration.\n",
            "*   **Nutritious Fuel:** Plan healthy, balanced meals and snacks (e.g., fruits, nuts, whole grains). Avoid excessive sugary drinks and processed foods that can lead to energy crashes.\n",
            "*   **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. A consistent sleep schedule significantly impacts memory, focus, and overall well-being.\n",
            "*   **Daily Movement:** Integrate at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days. This could be a brisk walk, cycling, or a workout.\n",
            "*   **Mindful Screen Time:** Step away from all screens (including phones) for at least 30-60 minutes before bedtime.\n",

            "*   **Natural Light:** Position your study area near a window to maximize natural light during the day. Turn off artificial lights when they're not needed.\n",
            "*   **Unplug & Conserve:** Turn off lights, monitors, and unplug chargers when not in use or when leaving your study space to save electricity.\n",
            "*   **Reusable Supplies:** Opt for reusable pens, highlighters (refillable where possible), and a reusable water bottle or coffee cup.\n",
            "*   **Eco-Friendly Snacks:** Choose local, seasonal produce for snacks and meals, and prepare food at home to reduce packaging waste and support sustainable agriculture.\n",
            "*   **Conscious Commute:** If you study outside your home, consider walking, cycling, or using public transport instead of driving.\n",
